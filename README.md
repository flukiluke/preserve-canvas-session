## About
This is a very basic Firefox extension that modifies the canvas_session cookie set by the [Canvas LMS](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) to not be a session cookie any more. The end result is that Canvas will stay logged in across browser sessions.

## Requirements
The extension expects that your Canvas instance is at a URL that begins with https://canvas.

## Installation
idk I'm still working out how to make Firefox extensions.

## Security
The Canvas mobile app already stays logged in forever, so this surely can't be too bad.
